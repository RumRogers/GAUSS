You are also encouraged to point out bugs & issues, make suggestions and pull requests!_**\r\n\r\nThe engine is meant to help HTML5 developers with the implementation of complex behaviors and to simplify the deploying of games in as many platforms as possible.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, a game exported with GAUSS will consist of a single HTML page, with every game resource embedded with base64 encoding.\r\n\r\nYour GAUSS projects will be saved as JSON files.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n**GAUSS** is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
